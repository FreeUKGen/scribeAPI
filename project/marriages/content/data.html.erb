## Data exports

With help from volunteers like yourself, we are extracting structured, building-level information from dozens of marriage license application index registers. Of course, the ultimate goal is to make this data publicly available. Having a searchable and structured index of names, dates, & marriage license details will of great use to genealogists, historians, digital humanities researchers, and others interested in exploring historical data sources.

After enough transcriptions are made, our team will determine the best way to get the data to you in an easy and accessible way. In the meantime, feel free to explore the collection assets themselves on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/nycmarriageindex) website.
