### How Transcription Works

Many transcription projects deal with deciphering and typing free-flowing text from digitized pages (say, from letters or diaries). This project has a different focus. The goal here is to produce a _structured_ data set extracted from historical records that are themselves highly structured. This involves identifying key fields on the page and then transcribing the text from those fields. For complex, age-worn documents written in 19th century script, this is a tall order. So we've devised a division of labor.

In _NYC Marriages_, transcription is broken into three free-standing tasks: marking, transcribing, and verifying. These tasks follow a sequence of work, but they can be performed independently of one another. One person may prefer the **Mark** task: identifying fields on the page and drawing boxes around them. This work provides a structure for the document that facilitates transcription of marked fields in the **Transcribe** task. This task too can be done in isolation, benefiting from the clearly placed data entry fields provided by previous volunteers in the marking stage.

Lastly, there is the **Verify** task. This one is all about ensuring the quality of the work done by others in the mark and transcribe stages. To ensure quality output, every marked field will be transcribed by multiple volunteers. Our software runs an algorithm that looks for agreement among the transcriptions. If a field has been transcribed consistently by several users, it has reached "consensus" and is added to the final data set. If there are conflicting entries, those are queued up for the verification task, in which users can vote on the most accurate transcription and, if needed, add their own.

### About the Software
_NYC Marriages_ is built on an open-source framework called [_Scribe_](http://scribeproject.github.io/) built by NYPL Labs and Zooniverse with generous support National Endowment for the Humanities. Scribe is modeled on the idea, described above, of distributed task flows and multi-user consensus, and is geared toward transcription projects that aim to produce structured data sets. It is designed to be highly configurable and able to handle a wide range of document types with varying structures.
