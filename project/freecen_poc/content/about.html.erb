## Scribe Proof-of-Concept

### Background
This site is a demonstration of the [Scribe Tool](http://scribeproject.github.io/) as applied to pre-processed census forms from FreeCEN.  It is intended to serve as a location to test the tool's suitability for our needs, and explore different configuration options and work-flows.
